## TL;DR
> Is this is the coolest thing ever?


This [repo](https://github.com/daneroo/ir-logo),
and it's associated [site](https://ir-logo.netlify.com/) is an effort to practice composition,
refactoring, and reuse.

The repo is published as an npm package containing assets and react components.
The site is generated by [docz](https://www.docz.site/) from [.mdx](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) files.

The content is a mix of previous playful artwork for team logos. 
They were originally authored in `svg`, and rasterized into `png`.

The React components are tested with snapshots with Jest.
