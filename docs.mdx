# Overview

> Is this is the coolest thing ever?


This [repo](https://github.com/daneroo/ir-logo),
and it's associated site is an effort to practice composition,
refactoring, and reuse.

The repo is published as an npm package containing assets and react components.
The site is generated by [docz](https://www.docz.site/) from [.mdx](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) files.

The content is a mix of previous playful artwork for team logos. 
They were originally authored in `svg`, and rasterized into `png`.

The React components are tested with snapshots with Jest.
