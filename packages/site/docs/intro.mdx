## TL;DR

Legacy readme, before conversion to docusaurus and lerna (WIP)

> Learned a lot with this weekend project!
> - Authored using **SVG**
> - **React** for composition and reuse
> - [React Hooks]((https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)) for state management
> - Continous testing and preview for development (**HMR**)
> - DOM Snapshot testing with **Jest**
> - Published components to **npm**
> - CI/CD deploys to **Netlify CDN** on push to master

This [repo](https://github.com/daneroo/ir-logo),
and it's associated [site](https://ir-logo.netlify.com/) is an effort to practice composition,
refactoring, and reuse.

The repo is published as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@daneroo/ir-logo) containing assets and react components.
The site is generated by [docz](https://www.docz.site/) from [.mdx](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) files.

The content is a mix of previous playful artwork for team logos. 
They were originally authored in `svg`, and rasterized into `png`.

The React components are tested with [Jest using Snapshot Testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing).
