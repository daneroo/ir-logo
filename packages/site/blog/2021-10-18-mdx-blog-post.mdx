# Move to Docusaurus and Lerna

I just moved this static site to [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).
It was previously based on [docz](https://www.docz.site/).

The git repository is structured as a lerna monorepo.

The lerna setup is underway, but React components are not yet externalized as a library
